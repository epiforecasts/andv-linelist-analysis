Distribution of the convolved chain delay `δ + Inc(sec)`, with
`Inc(sec) ~ inc` and `δ ~ δ`. Used as the joint right-truncation
distribution for sourced offspring at a real-time cut-off.

`cdf(d, x; upper_δ = Inf)` evaluates `P(δ + Inc ≤ x ∧ δ ≤ upper_δ)`
by GaussLegendre quadrature over
`(mean(d.δ) − K·std(d.δ), min(upper_δ, mean(d.δ) + K·std(d.δ)))`.
With the default `upper_δ = Inf` the integration domain is the full
truncated support and the result is the ordinary chain-completion
CDF. A finite `upper_δ` caps the inner δ integral and is used by
[`_pipeline_probability`](@ref) for the controlled-outbreak
counterfactual.

Accepts both `x::Real` (returns a scalar) and `x::AbstractVector`
(returns a vector, evaluating every point in a single GaussLegendre
solve). Prefer the vector form when evaluating at many points:
`cdf.(d, xs)` would otherwise trigger one solve per element.

$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Strict controlled-outbreak counterfactual: predict future onsets
assuming all transmission stops at `intervention_time` (default
`obs_time`).
Only people already infected by `intervention_time` (transmission event
before the cut-off, chain not yet symptomatic) contribute.
For each posterior draw and observed source `i`, the contribution is
`Poisson(λ_i · pipeline_i)` where
`pipeline_i = P(δ ≤ Δ_q[i] ∧ δ + Inc > Δ_p[i])`
is the joint probability that transmission from source `i` happened
by `Δ_q[i] = intervention_time_i − T_onset[i]` *and* the offspring is
still in incubation at the observation horizon
`Δ_p[i] = obs_time − T_onset[i]`,
`p_i = cdf(ConvolvedDelays(inc, δ), Δ_p[i])` is the probability the
full chain has completed by `obs_time`, and
`λ_i | Z_obs[i], k, R_i, p_i ~ Gamma(k + Z_obs[i], R_i / (k + R_i · p_i))`.
`pipeline_i` is evaluated via [`_pipeline_probability`](@ref), which
truncates `δ` at `Δ_q[i]` before convolving with `Inc` so the formula
is correct whether the intervention precedes, coincides with, or
follows the observation cut-off.
Incubation and transmission timing distributions per draw are
recovered from the fitted `model`'s submodels via `DynamicPPL.fix`.

The prediction is a pure function of the fit (the fitted `model`, its
chain, posterior summary, and the same `d` the model was fit on).
[`realised_future_count`](@ref) returns the corresponding realised
count from the full line list as a separate evaluation step.

Returns a named tuple with fields `future_samples` (a `Vector{Int}` of
length `n_draws` giving the total future count per draw),
`future_samples_per_source` (an `n_draws × N` `Matrix{Int}` whose row
sums equal `future_samples`), and `n_obs`. Use
[`per_source_predictive_summary`](@ref) to turn the per-source matrix
into a `DataFrame` for downstream diagnostics.

# Arguments
- `model`: the `DynamicPPL.Model` that produced `chn`, carrying the
  incubation, transmission, and observation submodels under

- `chn`: chain from a real-time joint fit.
- `post`: posterior summary returned by `summarise(chn)`.
- `d`: structured line-list data the model was fit on (returned by
  `build_data`).

# Keyword Arguments
- `obs_time`: cut-off `Date`.
- `t0`: time origin `Date`.
- `intervention_time`: when transmission stops. Three forms are
  accepted:
  - `nothing` (default): intervention coincides with `obs_time` for
    every source, equivalent to passing `obs_time` as a scalar `Date`.
  - A scalar `Date`: applies uniformly to every source.
    `Δ_q[i] = intervention_time − T_onset[i]`. Sources whose onset is
    after `intervention_time` get a negative `Δ_q[i]`, so
    `q_i = cdf(δ, Δ_q[i])` evaluates in the left tail of the
    transmission-timing distribution.
  - A `Vector{Date}` of length `N` (one entry per observed source):
    encodes per-source intervention dates, useful when isolation
    timing differs across cases (e.g. a per-case isolation date
    derived from `ll_rt.onset_date`). Element `i` sets
    `Δ_q[i] = intervention_time[i] − T_onset[i]`.
